bio: |
  I’m an undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong majoring in Computer Science and Finance, driven by a long-standing interest in building intelligent agents that can interact with the real world.

  Growing up in Beijing and attending the High School Affiliated to Renmin University, I was drawn early to systems that blend logic, control, and human-facing complexity.

  My academic path has taken me from AI coursework at HKU to research at UC Davis and ByteDance’s Volcano Engine, where I now evaluate tool-calling capabilities of state-of-the-art LLM agents.

  My work spans building web-interaction models, benchmarking agent grounding, and tuning multimodal prompts — always with the goal of making agents that are not only powerful, but also actionable and reliable.

  As I prepare for graduate study, I hope to keep exploring the intersection of systems and intelligence, with a vision of enabling agents that can eventually assist, extend, and transform how people live and work.

  **Research Interests:**
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Embedded & Distributed Agents
  - Multi-Agent Collaboration
  - Evaluation & Reasoning Benchmarks
